a.  Description of the Project
The Data Processing Application is a web application developed using Laravel that focuses on performing heavy data processing tasks such as complex calculations. The application utilizes Web Workers to offload these intensive tasks to separate threads, aiming to compare the performance with and without Web Workers to assess the impact on processing speed and overall user experience.

b. Instructions on How to Run the Project Locally
1-git clone https://github.com/faizan2baig/EAD-Web Worker.git
2-composer install
3-php artisan migrate
4-php artisan serve

c. Summary of Findings Regarding Performance Improvements
By utilizing Web Workers in the Data Processing Application, significant performance improvements were observed, especially when handling large datasets or performing complex calculations. The use of Web Workers offloads these intensive tasks to separate threads, preventing UI freezing and enhancing the responsiveness of the application. Comparing the performance with and without Web Workers showed noticeable speed enhancements in data processing tasks, leading to an improved user experience.

d. Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome
Implementation Complexity: Integrating Web Workers into the Laravel application initially posed challenges due to the need for additional JavaScript code and communication between the main thread and Web Workers. This was overcome by carefully designing the architecture and using Laravel's built-in support for managing JavaScript assets.

Testing and Benchmarking: Accurately measuring the performance improvements required thorough testing and benchmarking of the application with and without Web Workers. This was achieved by creating test cases for various data processing scenarios and using profiling tools to analyze the execution time of different tasks.
